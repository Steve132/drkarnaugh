Current Project todo list:]

CRITICAL FEATURES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gameplay code/RankedGame

MazeItem render methods -- So the mazeItems aren't spheres lodged in the floor and we can tell what we're looking at

Wall Collision

I think We'll need Some way of communicating to the player which inputs are which... like maybe a spray painted number on each of them or something?  eg 00, 01, 32 etc Because, say, A+ (B*A) is not the same as B + (A*B) when, say, a = 1 and b = 0.  the first evaluates to 1 and the second to 0.  

the Goggles


Local High Score Table/User Account files:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Local high score table Displays users in a list in order, with total score, since, "best game" for custom is pretty worthless, followed by best ranked game score eg 

User   Total Points     Best Ranked Game
Chris  100000           100

Can click on a particular user name for a popup with more information, extracted from the file:
total points, best game score, best map score, best ranked game score, total time played, etc.  

Modify online code to store users, so we can display top users in addition to top scores

STATUS BAR FONTS: I cleared some space by making the max number of inputs 8, which still has a truth table size of 256, still plenty ridiculous for anything but the simplest puzzles.  There's room for 70 characters plus tghe maximum truth table display in 640x480 resolution, which I'm going to suggest as our minimum supported resolution-- but I do think that maybe we should include an option for the display bar font size when we get around to the options menu, because it is a little small at 1440x900 resolutions, and I know that a lot of gamers with high end systems run games in resolutions at least that high, sometimes significantly higher.
