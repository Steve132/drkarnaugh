Current Project todo list:]

CRITICAL FEATURES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gameplay code/RankedGame

MazeItem render methods -- So the mazeItems aren't spheres lodged in the floor and we can tell what we're looking at

Wall Collision

I think We'll need Some way of communicating to the player which inputs are which... like maybe a spray painted number on each of them or something?  eg 00, 01, 32 etc Because, say, A+ (B*A) is not the same as B + (A*B) when, say, a = 1 and b = 0.  the first evaluates to 1 and the second to 0.  

the Goggles


Local High Score Table/User Account files:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Local high score table Displays users in a list in order, with total score, since, "best game" for custom is pretty worthless, followed by best ranked game score eg 

User   Total Points     Best Ranked Game
Chris  100000           100

Can click on a particular user name for a popup with more information, extracted from the file:
total points, best game score, best map score, best ranked game score, total time played, etc.  

Modify online code to store users, so we can display top users in addition to top scores
