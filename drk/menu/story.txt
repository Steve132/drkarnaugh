While working in the lab one day, Dr. Karnaugh experienced a breakthrough in 
technology. Being the electrical scienctist he is, Dr. Karnaugh built a machine 
that would cure the world of all its diseases through pulses of electricity. What 
Dr. Karnaugh did not expect was that the machine was so powerful that it blew 
a hole underneath him all the way to the basement of his mansion. The machine 
Dr. Karnaugh built had electrically changed the locks on all the doors and cut the 
power to all the rooms but one. With the machine going out of control, 
Dr. Karnaugh must solve his way back up to the top floor to cut the machines power.
